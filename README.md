This is for the USDA problem set under the data analytics focus of IC24

Problem Statement

Resources for analytical sampling continue to decline and staffing is becoming increasingly limited, FDC is establishing new ways to incorporate data. 
It is not feasible to analyze a complete set of nutrients for a single food when the cost of analysis can exceed $50,000.
Gathering insight into how comparable foods have changed over time will provide a better idea as to which components should continue to be analyzed and which ones remain constant and not necessarily analyzed each time a food is updated.

This data analysis will specifically focuse on "Foundation Foods" and "Standard Reference (SR) Legacy" foods. 

Foundation Foods - Data and metadata on individual samples of commodity or commodity-derived minimally processed foods with insights into variability	

Standard Reference (SR) Legacy - Historic data on food components including nutrients derived from analyses, calculations, and published literature
